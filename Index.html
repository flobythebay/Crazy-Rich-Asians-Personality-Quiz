        <p id="interests">  If I had a choice, everyday I would run around the fields, riding my strong horse, Khan. Then, in the afternoon, I like to meet with my friends, lift some weights, practice my swordsmanship, and shoot some arrows. Sometimes, randomly throughout the day, I will just obserbve the world, taking time to reflect and even brainstorm creative ways to protect China.  </p>
